## Chaidoro Mobile (Android - Flutter)

This is the mobile version of the Chaidoro developed and maintained by [ Rufat Mammadov | ChaiNET](https://github.com/rufat-dev) using Flutter/Dart.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

## What makes Pomodoro so effective?
We literally don't know :D, while all of our dev team uses it and we all believe it helps us to keep productive. For that reason we decided to make our own version of it.

## What is Chaidoro ?
Chaidoro is the web application that aims to provide the best pomodoro experience with no data stored on our side and completely open source for its users. All the data is stored at your browser using local storage.

## What is ChaiNET ?
We made of developers creating open source software to help other students / people improve their daily life habits. Our desire is to promote the use of open source! We have no desire to make money or collect data from the applications we produce.

We also offer various private web services to companies.
